Workman keyboard layouts
========================

Workman keyboard layout originally proposed by OJ Bucao at http://viralintrospection.wordpress.com/2010/09/06/a-different-philosophy-in-designing-keyboard-layouts/.

## Important design note

The original Workman-P proposal by OJ Bucao sought to reverse keys for backtick (`) and brackets ([]), however when considering the Objective-C and PHP programming languages, both make heavy use of the original, primary characters. Swapping them makes those frequent characters more work. **In this repository, only the number keys are reversed** to special characters.
