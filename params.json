It accounts for wrist movement to the middle columns and the reaching and folding preferences of each finger. Workman was named on Labor Day in honor of all who type on keyboards for a living.\r\n\r\n![Workman keyboard layout](https://raw.github.com/deekayen/workman/f37e7a0173ef9669905be8330d9e3671991c30e3/workman_layout.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nWorkman is designed around the following principles:\r\n\r\n *  Prioritize the home keys\r\n *  If vertical folding and reaching cannot be prevented, prioritize reaching for longer fingers and folding for shorter fingers.\r\n * Place more frequent keys under stronger fingers\r\n * Common bigrams should be easy to type.\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n * It’s different from QWERTY\r\n * **Comfortable, ergonomic, and efficient** — frequent keys are placed within the natural range of motion of the fingers\r\n * **Reduced lateral movement of the fingers and wrists**\r\n * **Very, very low overall finger travel**\r\n * **Reduced load on the right pinky** compared to Dvorak and Colemak\r\n * **More balanced left and right hand usage** compared to Dvorak and Colemak\r\n * **High same hand utilization** and plenty of easy combos\r\n * Common English bigrams are easy to type\r\n * **ZXCV shortcuts are still accessible with one hand**\r\n * Capslock is Backspace (linux only)\r\n * Shift+Capslock is Escape (linux only)\r\n * **Only 21 characters are different from QWERTY** as opposed to 31 for Dvorak\r\n * Not as intimidating or “alien” looking as other alternatives\r\n * Available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n * It’s different from QWERTY\r\n * C and V shortcuts are slightly shifted to the right and needs a little getting used to\r\n * 21 letters are moved compared to Colemak’s 17\r\n * Left ring finger has slightly higher load compared to QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n> Workman reduces overall usage of the two middle columns by about 50% over Colemak. This 50% reduction can be divided into two parts, horizontal and diagonal index finger stretching. Workman reduces horizontal finger stretching by 63%, and diagonal index finger stretching by 27% over Colemak. This is because Workman efficiently utilizes other easy to reach keys instead of just placing them in the middle columns where they are difficult to reach. **Workman also reduces vertical index finger stretching by 30% over Colemak by realizing that it’s easier for the index finger to fold than reach upwards.**\r\n\r\n[A different philosophy in designing keyboard layouts](http://www.workmanlayout.com/)\r\n\r\n![Graded workman keys](https://raw.github.com/deekayen/workman/71cf354a09329600a2b777a09714ad9d0575ee80/keyboard_graded.png)\r\n\r\n## Layout evaluation\r\n\r\nIn the circles of keyboard layouts, the [Carpalx](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/) site is well-known for its evaluation of various keyboard layouts and its trumpeting of the [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) layout as a premier contender. In the [Carpalx study](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?keyboard_layouts), with various, fancy calculations, it assigned QWERTY a base score of 3 and proceeded to compare other layouts, lower scores are better.\r\n\r\n * [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY): 3\r\n * [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard): 2.098\r\n * Workman: 1.993\r\n * [Capewell-Dvorak](http://www.michaelcapewell.com/projects/keyboard/index.htm#The_Capewell-Dvorak_Layout): 1.985\r\n * [Asset](http://millikeys.sourceforge.net/asset/): 1.894\r\n * Klausler: 1.867\r\n * [Colemak](http://colemak.com/): 1.842\r\n * [QGMLWY](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization): 1.670\r\n\r\nThe Carpalx study goes on to recommend other optimizations, supposedly scoring even better than Colemak. The clearest outcome from the study is that you can use almost any layout other than QWERTY and gain significant efficiencies in your finger travel. Most major operating systems have both Dvorak and Colemak built-in; the Carpalx model almost makes all others seem like a waste of time.\r\n\r\n### Flawed Carpalx cap scoring\r\n\r\n![Carpalx keyboard cost heatmap](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/images/keyboard-cost.png)\r\n\r\nThe Carpalx study takes a similar model to what is used in Workman, by scoring the press of each key, however it doesn't appear to take into account the length of each finger and its curling or stretching preferences. In QWERTY, the **Q and E are scored the same**. When I type, my whole palm moves when I type Q, but not when I type E. Therefore, I believe the adjusted score used in Workman is more appropriate to evaluate layouts.\r\n\r\n### Flawed sample inputs\r\n\r\nThe scores for the Carpalx study were based on the typing effort of various classic novels, downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/). The training set was Alice in Wonderland, Dracula, Great Expectations, Huckleberry Finn, Moby Dick, Picture of Dorian Grey, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Count of Monte Cristo, Ulysses, Walden (7371647 characters, 3085666 triads, 7967 unique triads).\r\n\r\nNo surprises here - the Carpalx project clearly got a large sample size for typing analysis.\r\n\r\nI prefer to use more modern writing for my inputs. I'm not likely to type many fiction novels in my lifetime. I also think considering the likely audience of various layouts is appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Scoring with the Workman model\r\n\r\nForgoing sophisticated mathematic models, I re-ran a similar Carpalx-style ranking test using the scoring used per key cap in the Workman layout. Every time a letter is used, it adds to a simple counter. In scoring a body of literature with Workman, letter S adds 1 point to the total, D is 2 points, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen scoring the following sentence, lower is better:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\r\n```\r\n\r\n * QWERTY: 86\r\n * Asset: 71\r\n * Capewell-Dvorak: 73\r\n * Colemak: 73\r\n * Dvorak: 62\r\n * Klausler: 76\r\n * QGMLWY: 69\r\n * Workman: 68\r\n\r\n### Defining \"normal\" typing\r\n\r\nThe lazy dog sample is perfect for showing all characters of the alphabet, but not necessarily representative of \"normal\" typing conditions. \"Normal\" typing is different for everyone. Phones should have a different effort scale than keyboards. Novelists type different content than programmers.\r\n\r\n#### Carpalx repeated\r\n\r\nFrom [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), the following novels were [concatenated](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/concatenated), then scored using the Workman points model: Alice in Wonderland, Dracula, Great Expectations, Huckleberry Finn, Moby Dick, Picture of Dorian Grey, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, The Count of Monte Cristo, Ulysses, Walden.\r\n\r\n * QWERTY: 20,120,599\r\n * Asset: 11,822,761\r\n * Capewell-Dvorak: 11,192,965\r\n * Colemak: 11,654,898\r\n * Dvorak: 12,808,226\r\n * Klausler: 12,159,029\r\n * QGMLWY: 11,972,026\r\n * Workman: 10,564,202\r\n\r\n **Winner: Workman**\r\n\r\n#### Programmer\r\n\r\nScoring the [Drupal 7.17](http://drupal.org/drupal-7.17-release-notes) source code evaluates a variety of [PHP](http://php.net), Javascript, CSS, HTML, license files, and documentation.\r\n\r\n * QWERTY: 16,369,994\r\n * Asset: 10,125,959\r\n * Capewell-Dvorak: 11,141,475\r\n * Colemak: 9,894,567\r\n * Dvorak: 12,427,450\r\n * Klausler: 11,379,587\r\n * QGMLWY: 10,518,455\r\n * Workman: 9,756,881\r\n\r\n **Winner: Workman**\r\n\r\n#### Fiction novelist\r\n\r\n[The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MQYOFW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002MQYOFW&linkCode=as2&tag=deekayen-20):\r\n\r\n * QWERTY: 941,339\r\n * Asset: 545,135\r\n * Capewell-Dvorak: 503,499\r\n * Colemak: 533,696\r\n * Dvorak: 580,857\r\n * Klausler: 554,396\r\n * QGMLWY: 556,917\r\n * Workman: 489,802\r\n\r\n **Winner: Workman**\r\n\r\n#### Technical writer\r\n\r\nThe [CISSP 5th ed exam guide by Shon Harris](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZK5EE4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003ZK5EE4&linkCode=as2&tag=deekayen-20) is very technical:\r\n\r\n * QWERTY: 5,352,819\r\n * Asset: 2,870,112\r\n * Capewell-Dvorak: 2,895,753\r\n * Colemak: 2,815,194\r\n * Dvorak: 3,321,090\r\n * Klausler: 3,194,384\r\n * QGMLWY: 3,072,491\r\n * Workman: 2,696,435\r\n\r\n **Winner: Workman**\r\n\r\n#### Non-fiction education\r\n\r\n[The Montessori Method by Maria Montessori](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DJ0NU0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005DJ0NU0&linkCode=as2&tag=deekayen-20):\r\n\r\n * QWERTY: 1,206,066\r\n * Asset: 665,413\r\n * Capewell-Dvorak: 628,705\r\n * Colemak: 660,478\r\n * Dvorak: 743,373\r\n * Klausler: 688,398\r\n * QGMLWY: 697,182\r\n * Workman: 590,811\r\n\r\n **Winner: Workman**\r\n\r\n#### Blogging\r\n\r\nHere is the score for all the bodies of the articles on the front page of [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) on November 15, 2012.

You'll lose lots of productivity for a relatively short time. **The difference between QWERTY and *anything* else is huge**. If you're going to go through all the effort, you should go with Workman.\r\n\r\n## Layout files\r\n\r\nThe proposed layout files were originally spread all over the internet. The github repository will allow contributions to come from all over the Internet and merge back to a central project through pull requests.\r\n\r\nWorkman-P is Workman for Programmers. In Workman-P, the top-row numbers and symbols have been switched. The original proposal also switched the backtick, brace and brackets, however that was dropped after some discussion about how helpful that change actually was to programmers of PHP, Bash, and Objective-C. Workman-P is great for programmers as well as system administrators.\r\n\r\n### Workman-M (proposed mobile layout)\r\n\r\nAfter spending some time learning Colemak on my Android phone using [SwiftKey](http://www.swiftkey.net/), I decided I needed to use the same style scoring model used by OJ for the original Workman layout. Below is my proposal for scores and the resulting layout after using both thumbs to practice various thumb stretching options on a Galaxy S II.\r\n\r\n * **Only 15 keys are different than QWERTY**, vs 17 for Colemak, 21 for Workman, and 31 for Dvorak.\r\n * **Prioritizes for two-thumb use** in landscape\r\n * **Does not optimize for the entire home row** as more traditional layouts would do\r\n\r\n![Workman-M layout](https://raw.github.com/deekayen/workman/0c729196b208efd8e3846834b280b1aae7527643/images/workman-m.png?w=870)\r\n\r\n## Supported education\r\n * [Type Fu](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/type-fu/id509818877)\r\n * [Master Key](http://macinmind.com/) ([drills](https://github.com/deekayen/master-key-workman))\r\n * [Klavaro](http://klavaro.sourceforge.net/en/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Klavaro\r\nCreate a file called “workman_us.kbd” and place it in a directory like “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Klavaro-1.9.4/share/klavaro/workman_us.kbd”.\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the following into the file, then save it.
