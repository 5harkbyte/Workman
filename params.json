{"tagline":"Colemak grew up and turned into Workman","body":"# Workman keyboard layout\r\nWorkman is designed around the following principles:\r\n\r\n *  Prioritize the home keys\r\n *  If vertical folding and reaching cannot be prevented, prioritize reaching for longer fingers and folding for shorter fingers.\r\n * Place more frequent keys under stronger fingers\r\n * Common bigrams should be easy to type.\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n * It’s different from QWERTY\r\n * **Comfortable, ergonomic, and efficient** — frequent keys are placed within the natural range of motion of the fingers\r\n * **Reduced lateral movement of the fingers and wrists**\r\n * **Very, very low overall finger travel**\r\n * **Reduced load on the right pinky** compared to Dvorak and Colemak\r\n * **More balanced left and right hand usage** compared to Dvorak and Colemak\r\n * **High same hand utilization** and plenty of easy combos\r\n * Common English bigrams are easy to type\r\n * **ZXCV shortcuts are still accessible with one hand**\r\n * Capslock is Backspace (linux only)\r\n * Shift+Capslock is Escape (linux only)\r\n * **Only 21 characters are different from QWERTY** as opposed to 31 for Dvorak\r\n * Not as intimidating or “alien” looking as other alternatives\r\n * Available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n * It’s different from QWERTY\r\n * C and V shortcuts are slightly shifted to the right and needs a little getting used to\r\n * 21 letters are moved compared to Colemak’s 17\r\n * Left ring finger has slightly higher load compared to QWERTY, Dvorak, and Colemak.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n> Workman reduces overall usage of the two middle columns by about 50% over Colemak. This 50% reduction can be divided into two parts, horizontal and diagonal index finger stretching. Workman reduces horizontal finger stretching by 63%, and diagonal index finger stretching by 27% over Colemak. This is because Workman efficiently utilizes other easy to reach keys instead of just placing them in the middle columns where they are difficult to reach. **Workman also reduces vertical index finger stretching by 30% over Colemak by realizing that it’s easier for the index finger to fold than reach upwards.**\r\n\r\n[A different philosophy in designing keyboard layouts](http://viralintrospection.wordpress.com/2010/09/06/a-different-philosophy-in-designing-keyboard-layouts/)\r\n\r\n![Graded workman keys](http://viralintrospection.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/keyboard_graded1.png?w=580)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n![Workman layout](http://viralintrospection.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/workman_layout.png?w=870)\r\n\r\n## Layout files\r\n\r\nThe proposed layout files were originally spread all over the internet. The github repository will allow contributions to come from all over the Internet and merge back to a central project through pull requests.\r\n\r\nWorkman-P is Workman for Programmers. In Workman-P, the top-row numbers and symbols have been switched. The original proposal also switched the backtick, brace and brackets, however that was dropped after some discussion about how helpful that change actually was to programmers of PHP, Bash, and Objective-C. Workman-P is great for programmers as well as system administrators.\r\n\r\n## Supported education\r\n * [Master Key](http://macinmind.com/) ([drills](https://github.com/deekayen/master-key-workman))\r\n * [Type Fu](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/type-fu/id509818877)\r\n\r\n## Supported hardware\r\n * [TypeMatrix](http://typematrix.com/)\r\n\r\n## Todo list\r\n * Submit Workman to base Debian Linux project\r\n * Submit Workman to Arch Linux project\r\n * [Submitted](http://code.google.com/p/chromium-os/issues/detail?id=35963&thanks=35963&ts=1351797208) to Chromium OS\r\n * Get Workman accepted into Mac OS\r\n * Get Workman accepted into iOS\r\n * Add Workman to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout) and make it stick\r\n * [Added](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Workman) a definition in [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/)\r\n * Add a download to [Softpedia](http://www.softpedia.com/)\r\n\r\n## Moving keyboard keys around\r\n\r\n[Flickr example](http://www.flickr.com/photos/skeltoac/1701201255/)","note":"Don't delete this file!
